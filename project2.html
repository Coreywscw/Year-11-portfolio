<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>

<br>

<h2>End users</h2>
<p> This project is targeted at people who like playing tic tac toe or people who want to kill time playing tic tac toe.
<br> This project is made for kids as kids will most likely be playing the most since they have the most free time.
<br> It will also benefit kids the most, it could provide kids with a game to play with their friends and increase their problem solving ability.
</p>
<br>

<br>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p> Simplicity is important since kids my not know how to use the game. Making the game as simple as possible will ensure the kids know how to start and select game modes.
<br>A multiplayer gamemode is important so kids can play with their friends if they wish instead of playing a computer.
<br>A single player gamemode since not everyone has a friend to play with, the player would be versing a computer that makes either random moves or plays the best move depending on the difficulty level.
<br>Giving the user an option to view the rules is very important since not everyone especially kids knows how to play Tic Tac Toe.

<br>
</p>
<h2>Implications</h2>
<p> We will ensure our users privacy is secure because none of the information given to us is saved and the users data is stored in a variable not a computer.
<br> We will add rules that are easy for kids to understand and remember to make that game usable for all ages.
<br> We will ensure the game is fun by making sure there is no issues or bugs.

<h2>Development</h2>
<p> Working with Finaly and James is a curse and a blessing since they do lots of work but also don't leave much for me.
<br> I managed to create a piece of code that asks the user if they would like to play singleplayer of multiplayer and their name (see below).

<h2>Testing</h2>
<table>

      <tr>
        <th>Test/Input</th>
        <th>Expectation</th>
        <th>Output</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
   
    <tr>
      <td>No Input</td>
      <td>Asks the user what gamemode they would like to play singleplayer or multiplayer </td>
      <td><img class ='listimg' src="gamemode select2.jpg" alt="gamemode select2" /></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Multiplayer</td>
      <td>Carrys on with the code and runs the next line. </td>
      <td><img class ='listimg' src="gamemode select3.jpg" alt="gamemode select3" /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <h2>Feedback</h2>
  <p> How can I  improve my function?</p>
  <p> "Add 1 name for singleplayer and 2 for multiplayer"</p>
  <p> "Put the rules into the introduction function so they can learn the rules before choosing the gamemode"</p>

  <h2>Improvements</h2>
  <p>The first improvement I made was the code asking for a name or names before the Tic-Tac-Toe begins,
  <br> if the gamemode multiplayer is selected the code will ask for two names however if the gamemode singlerplayer is selected the code will ask for 1 name.

  <p>The second imporvements I made was making the code ask if the player wants the rules before asking the player what gamemode they would like to play.</p>
