<h2>End users</h2>
<p> This project is targeted at people who like playing tic tac toe or people who want to kill time playing tic tac toe.
<br> This project is made for kids as kids will most likely be playing the most since they have the most free time.
<br> It will also benefit kids the most, it could provide kids with a game to play with their friends and increase their problem solving ability.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p> Simplicity is important since kids my not know how to use the game. Making the game as simple as possible will ensure the kids know how to start and select game modes.
<br>A multiplayer gamemode is important so kids can play with their friends if they wish instead of playing a computer.
<br>A single player gamemode since not everyone has a friend to play with, the player would be versing a computer that makes either random moves or plays the best move depending on the difficulty level.
<br>Giving the user an option to view the rules is very important since not everyone especially kids knows how to play Tic Tac Toe.

<br> We will ensure the game is fun by making sure there is no issues or bugs.
